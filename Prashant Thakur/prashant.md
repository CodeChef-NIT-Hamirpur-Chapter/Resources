`Remember, Competitive Programming is not a sprint race, it's a marathon!`

You may get disheartened if you are unable to solve a problem 😞, but it means **you are really on the right track!**😄

Think of every question like : 
"This problem will teach me something". 
If you get it and you knew it, that's okay but don't do same concept problems repeatedly.

If you get it and didn't knew it earlier, that means you are improving.😄

If you didn't get it, there are some cases:

The question may be too hard for you. 🥲

How to know if it's too hard?

*Remember to do this problem after a day or two*, to really make sure that, **Yes you got the concept.**

Suppose the problem is easy but then also you didn't got it. 😬

It happens sometimes. Some problems are like a point to be noted. If you got the point, you will be able solve the problem, otherwise you will just get confused.

Now the point is how to know in which questions we should care about these points?

Although this thing comes with time, but if you are practicing then most probably you will need this **observation** in **IMPLEMENTATION** problems.

**Remember to enjoy every moment of CP**. Yes, there will be some who are better than you, but why to care about them 🙂, why to look at them?

Yes get to know about their strategies but don't just think about them.

Although you shouldn't do CP for money or something else, do it for fun, this fun journey will help you a lot in the future, but if you want to know what one can get by doing CP : 
Search for **tourist competitive programming** and get the motivation. 😄

**Happy CP Journey.**
