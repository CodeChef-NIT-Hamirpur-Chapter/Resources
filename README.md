4. *Codeforces Blogs* - We all agree there are **MANY** competitive programmers around the world, thus someone might have already written something about `whatever` you are trying to learn. There are many useful codeforces blogs that are helpful. So whenever you are learning something new and want to learn some tricks, just google `<topic name> codeforces`

* Examples of some useful blogs:
  - [The Ultimate topic list](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95106)
  - [Graph problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55219?#comment-390897)
  - [C++ tricks](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/15643)

# Practice websites
If you want to do problems about some specific topic, then i would recommend the following:
1. [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) - This is one of the most important places where you can learn almost anything related to CP. Everything here is nicely explained, and there are **problems** for each topic under their blog. 

2. [USACO](https://usaco.guide/) - USACO guide provides important resources, extensive problems (from various Online Judges) along with progress tracking.

3. [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) -  CSES problemset has some great problems.

# Tips
* Always sit with a pen and paper, and write/draw whatever that comes to your mind. 

* For graph problems, you can use [Graph editor](https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/) for plotting the graph.

* For enhancing your problem solving speed during contests, you can use `snippets`. [Code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.
[This Website](https://snippet-generator.app/) can help you make snippets easily for VSCode/Sublime Text/Atom.

* You can join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/5anpwH6r4f) and use `TLE` bot in it. Using TLE you can easily plot different graphs to understand your growth. The bot can also recommend you problems.

* Almost every error you get, is present on [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com). So just google your error and you will most probably find it's solution on stackoverflow.
