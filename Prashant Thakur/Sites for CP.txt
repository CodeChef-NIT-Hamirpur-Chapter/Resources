I will include many sites which I use for CP
There are no preferences because it doesn't matter after all. All I want is to solve better problems and enjoy the process.

Codeforces : https://codeforces.com/
Contains a lot of good questions. Also host regular contests which are necesary for a Competitive Programmer.
Some Questions can help in the real world as well. Overall one will feel happy after seeing "Accepted" and a little disheartened after seeing "Wrong answer on Test 2". :))

Codechef : https://www.codechef.com/#
Again a good CP site. Contains good questions, but as you will go to Div2 (you will get to know when you start giving contest on codechef) contest are not regular.
Overall a good website.

Atcoder : https://atcoder.jp/
If you want problems which ask directly what is required, then "Atcoder" is the site. Questions are short, but their quality matches codeforces problems.
They host many contests which also include "ABC" (Atcoder beginner contest), which I say is must for a beginner. 

CSES : https://cses.fi/problemset/list
This site contains only problems. But their level are good. Overall a nice website.

Then we have sites which may help you if you are unable to find a question for yourself :

Although i provided you this much, but there are lot of other sites which you may need to use in the future.
