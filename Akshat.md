# Contest websites
According to me, these are some of the best websites for problem solving as well as participating in contests:

1. [CodeChef](codechef.com) - Regular contests including `Starters` for beginners, and many other formats.
2. [Codeforces](codeforces.com) - Contests for each division are held regularly.
3. [Atcoder](atcoder.jp) - organises Atcoder Beginner Contests for beginners, which helps learn many new concepts.

# Learning websites
1. [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/LEARNDSA?itm_medium=navmenu&itm_campaign=learndsa) - Have their own CP and DSA Learning series, which has many relevant questions.

2. [Colin Galen's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpvS3EykHW--l0ogUhMEjEw) - Colin Galen is an **[International Master](https://codeforces.com/profile/galen_colin)** on codeforces and a youtuber. He has many streams of specific topics where he explains the topic and solves many problems. These can help you understand that topic better.

3. *Codeforces Blogs* - We all agree there are **MANY** competitive programmers around the world, thus someone might have already written something about `whatever` you are trying to learn. There are many useful codeforces blogs that are helpful. So whenever you are learning something new and want to learn some tricks, just google `<topic name> codeforces`

* Examples of some useful blogs:
  - [The Ultimate topic list](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95106)
  - [Graph problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55219?#comment-390897)
  - [C++ tricks](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/15643)

4. [CodeForces Edu Section](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2) - This provides insights on various topics like segment trees, binary search etc.

5. [CPP Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) - If you want to learn technical stuff about anything in C++, this website is best for you.

# Practice websites
If you want to do problems about some specific topic, then i would recommend the following:
1. [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) - This is one of the most important places where you can learn almost anything related to CP. Everything here is nicely explained, and there are **problems** for each topic under their blog. 

2. [USACO](https://usaco.guide/) - USACO guide provides important resources, extensive problems (from various Online Judges) along with progress tracking.

3. [Leetcode](leetcode.com) - Although this proves to be very important for interview preperation, leetcode is also home to some very challenging and great problems.

4. [Algoshots](https://algoshots.herokuapp.com/practicepage/) - This can help you find good problems of specific rating/specific topic.

5. [Codehunt](https://codehunt.cc/) - This website can help you filter through codeforces problems easily. (you can even include some and exclude other topics and find relevant problems)

6. [CF Tracker](https://cftracker.netlify.app/contests) -  Helps you see which problems you have attempted contest wise, and which you can.

# Tips
* Always sit with a pen and paper, and write/draw whatever that comes to your mind. 

* For graph problems, you can use [Graph editor](https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/) for plotting the graph.

* For enhancing your problem solving speed during contests, you can use `snippets`. [Code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.
[This Website](https://snippet-generator.app/) can help you make snippets easily.

* You can join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/5anpwH6r4f) and use `TLE` bot in it. Using TLE you can easily plot different graphs to understand your growth. The bot can also recommend you problems.

* Almost every error you get, is present on [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com). So just google your error and you will most probably find it's solution on stackoverflow.
